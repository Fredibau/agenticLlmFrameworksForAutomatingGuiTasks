Please note that while most of the code in this project is adopted from OSWorld, we have made various modifications. Specifically, the `run_client_agentic.py` script and its associated files (ClientAgenticArchitecture) and functions were newly added. Additionally, the `run_uitars` and `uitars_agent.py` script were modified to deliver comparable results.
